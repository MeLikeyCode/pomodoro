# Pomodoro
A distraction-free pomodoro timer that helps you stay focused.
- runs in the system tray
- shows notifications when its time to work or take a break
- keeps track of time worked (and time spent taking breaks) in a local log file so you can see your habbits
- plays study/work music in the background (no browser/music player winows need to be opened while you work anymore) (TODO)
- displays inspirational/motivational quotes during your *breaks* for positive reinforcement (does *not* display *anything* while you are working, to prevent distracting you) (TODO)
- easy "installation", just unzip and run `pomodoro.exe`
- runs entirely offline (comes with some music/quotes that can be used offline); the internet is full of distractions and this app will not force you to be there

The philosophy of this app is to be **distraction-free** and encourage you to stay as focused as possible. 

As a result, it does not need **any** windows open and is as minimal as possible in order to stay out of your way. 

Even opening a browser to play some study music is an opportunity for you to become distracted, so the app provides a distraction free way to get your work/study music. The UI (though admittedly ugly) is *minimal*. It is not meant to be looked at and enjoyed, it is not meant to entertain or awe, it is meant to be out of your way (literally, it goes to the tray), and ever so often nudge you back to focusing.

Currently only works on windows, but if you are a linux/mac user and wanna use this, create an issue on the github repo and I'll make it happen.
