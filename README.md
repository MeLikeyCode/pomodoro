# Pomodoro
A distraction-free pomodoro timer that helps you stay focused.
- runs in the system tray
- shows notifications when its time to work or take a break
- keeps track of time worked (and time spent taking breaks) in a local log file so you can see your habbits
- plays study/work music in the background (no browser/music player winows need to be opened while you work anymore) (TODO)
- displays inspirational/motivational quotes during your *breaks* for positive reinforcement (does *not* display *anything* while you are working, to prevent distracting you) (TODO)
- easy "installation", just unzip and run `pomodoro.exe`
- runs entirely offline (comes with some music/quotes that can be used offline); the internet is full of distractions and this app will not force you to be there
- app's design and implementation is driven by a philosophy of being minimalistic and distraction free; provides the things that you need to study/work comfortably and focused, without opening browser windows, where you have a high porbability of getting distracted

Currently only works on windows, but if you are a linux/mac user and wanna use this, create an issue on the github repo and I'll make it happen.
