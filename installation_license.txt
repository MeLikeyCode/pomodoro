Hello! Thanks so much for trying my pomodoro timer!

The motivation for creating this app came about because I was looking for a pomodor timer that did not need to have a window up all the time, one that just stayed out of your way and notified you when it was time to work, break, etc.

I was not able to find such a timer, so I created my own.

I also like to listen to music (study music) when I'm working, but having to open up a browser just to play some music opens a whole can of distraction-worms. So I added the ability for my app to play study music in the background, without any distracting windows up! It ships with some music (generously provided by amazingly creative/artistic people) so you can enjoy study music even when you are disconnected.

Anyways, I wanted to share this app, free of charge, to anyone who was looking for something similar, and I've developed this with good intentions, but I have to say that it is provided as-is, with no gurantees of any sorts. I'm not liable or responsible for anything that happens from you using this app.

With that out of the way, thanks again for using my app and I hope it helps you just a little bit!
